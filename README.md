## How to Run (Phone-Friendly Guide)

If you're on phone:

1. **Download the `.java` file you want to run**
2. Use any **Java compiler app** (like "Jvdroid" or "Dcoder") from the Play Store
3. Open the app, paste the code, and tap **Run**
4. Done — you'll see the output right below

If you're on PC (for future use):

1. Install JDK (Java Development Kit)
2. Open terminal or command prompt
3. Use these commands:

```bash
javac FileName.java     // to compile
java FileName           // to run
